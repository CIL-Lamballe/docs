Mattermost Cloud Overview
=========================

Mattermost Cloud is offered as a monthly subscription service. It is available free, indefinitely, for all workspaces that have 10 or fewer active users. Your subscription is upgraded to  pay-as-you-go once you reach 11 or more active users.

How Billing Works
-----------------

Active users are defined as users who fulfil the following criteria:

- Has created an account and joined a workspace and shows as **Active** in **System Console > Users**. 
- Counts towards your monthly bill for each day they are active in the billing period.

If a user is deactivated by a System Administrator they no longer count toward your monthly bill.

Billing periods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Billing periods end at 11:59 P.M. UTC on the final day of the month. We calculate usage for the billing period based on the number of users who were active and charge your credit card.

When you first begin your Mattermost Cloud subscription, after upgrading from the free tier, your first charge is at the end of the calendar month.

Adding and removing users in the middle of a billing period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add new users in the middle of a billing cycle, we’ll only charge for the days that the user was active. We’ll keep track of this for you, and bill you at the end of the cycle. 

Here’s an example:

*Your organization has a Mattermost Cloud workspace and you're paying monthly by credit card a rate of $10 per user per month. You add a new user 11 days into your billing period and that user remains active for the subsequent 19 days remaining in the month for a total of 20 days.

The prorated subscription cost for this user is determined by multiplying the monthly amount ($10) by the number of days they were active in the billing cycle (20) and dividing by the number of days in the month (30). The prorated subscription cost for the user added on day 11 is $6.67.*

Similarly, if you deactivate users in the middle of a billing cycle, we will calculate the prorated amount using the formula above to determine the prorated charge.

Viewing and Managing Billing details

Billing details are presented in the System Console under Billing & Account

Billing History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The billing history screen contains a list of all your monthly invoices and payments. 

Invoices appear in your billing history immediately after the billing period ends. 

Billing periods end at 11:59 P.M. UTC on the last day of the month, at which time subscription costs are calculated and a credit card charge is automatically attempted. It may take up to a day for our billing systems to calculate, charge your credit card, and issue your invoice. Once charges are completed, the invoice will show as paid. The invoice is a downloadable PDF file.

If you have a payment failure, your invoice will show payment failed. Please review the accuracy of your credit card information on the adjacent Payment Information screen (also under the Billing & Account section of the System Console). Unresolved failed payments may result in a delinquency and an interruption to your subscription. Please see failed and delinquent payments <link> for more information.

For questions regarding the details of your invoice please see  ‘How to read your invoice’

Company Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Company Information screen contains an area to add your company address where you are physically located. The company address will appear on your invoice if specified. Otherwise the billing address associated with the credit card on file will be used.

Payment Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credit cards are the only form of payment for customers on a monthly billing cycle. All major credit cards are accepted.

To add a new credit card first delete the saved card, then click on ‘Add a Credit Card’ in the top right of the subsequent screen. Mattermost only stores information pertaining to one credit card.
